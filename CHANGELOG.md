## 0.9.7 - TBD

sending to a handler.

API resources now support singular & plural, Rails friendly.

### Non-backwards compatible changes

`"mutator": "only_check_output_split"`.

### Other

Redis client connection heartbeat.

Improved graceful process termination.

Improved client socket ping/pong.
