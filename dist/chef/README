Vagrant - The provided Vagrant file is meant to allow testing of the entire sensu stack (client|server|api) in a Vagrant environment. It provisions the systems via chef.



This Vagrantfile assumes you have done the following 2 commands:

gem install vagrant
vagrant box add ubuntu-1104-server-i386 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7490647/talifun-ubuntu-11.04-server-i386.box


If you have your base system labeled other than base, please edit the Vagrantfile accordingly then run vagrant up.

After vagrant up runs and chef converges successfully, you should just have to point your browser to http://localhost:8080/ and get the sensu dashboard.

/etc/sensu/config.json is the default config file if you want to see what is generated and test from there.

Please come to #sensu on irc.freenode.net and we will be more than happy to help.
