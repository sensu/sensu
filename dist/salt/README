Initial salt contribution.

Currently covers:
    - Debian stable/testing
    - Installation of all required packages
    - Installation of sensu and sensu-dashboard via gem
    - Installation of lsb-style init scripts for services

Does not cover:
    - Setting up users/permission/vhosts on rabbitmq
    - Making config.json for you

Tested on:
    debian stable (+bpo for zmq)

How to use:
    Copy the contents of files and pillar into their respective directories
    in your salt tree.

    Alter files/top.sls and pillar/top.sls, selecting which hosts you want
    each service to go on.

    Edit configuration files in files/sensu/etc/sensu/ to reflect your
    environment. Files are referenced as sensu-$PART-$( hostname -s ).conf,
    which should allow all your sensu configs to coexist.

    Call salt \* state.highstate and you're off!
