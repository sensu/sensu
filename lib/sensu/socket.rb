  # EventMachine connection handler for the Sensu client's socket.
  #
  # The Sensu client listens on localhost, port 3030 (by default), for
  # UDP and TCP traffic. This allows software running on the host to
  # push check results (that may contain metrics) into Sensu, without
  # needing to know anything about Sensu's internal implementation.
  #
  # The socket only accepts 7-bit ASCII-encoded data.
  #
  # Although the Sensu client accepts UDP and TCP traffic, you must be
  # aware of the UDP protocol limitations. Any data you send over UDP
  # must fit in a single datagram and you will not receive a response
  # (no confirmation).
  #
  # == UDP Protocol ==
  #
  # If the socket receives a message containing whitespace and the
  # string +'ping'+, it will ignore it.
  #
  # The socket assumes all other messages will contain a single,
  # complete, JSON hash. The hash must be a valid JSON check result.
  # Deserialization failures will be logged at the ERROR level by the
  # Sensu client, but the sender of the invalid data will not be
  # notified.
  #
  # == TCP Protocol ==
  #
  # If the socket receives a message containing whitespace and the
  # string +'ping'+, it will respond with the message +'pong'+.
  #
  # The socket assumes any other stream will be a single, complete,
  # JSON hash. A deserialization failure will be logged at the WARN
  # level by the Sensu client and respond with the message
  # +'invalid'+. An +'ok'+ response indicates the Sensu client
  # successfully received the JSON hash and will publish the check
  # result.
  #
  # Streams can be of any length. The socket protocol does not require
  # any headers, instead the socket tries to parse everything it has
  # been sent each time a chunk of data arrives. Once the JSON parses
  # successfully, the Sensu client publishes the result. After
  # +WATCHDOG_DELAY+ (default is 500 msec) since the most recent chunk
  # of data was received, the agent will give up on the sender, and
  # instead respond +'invalid'+ and close the connection.
